          <mark class="bg-transparent cs-yellow">science and technology. </mark>
          I was always fascinated by how things worked.
          <br />
          &nbsp; When I was 13 I watched someone playing
          <mark class="bg-transparent cs-yellow">Counter Strike 1.6</mark>
          on a computer. I was amazed by the game and I wanted to play it too.
          That was when I began learning about computers. I was learning how to
          use a computer and more about the internet.
          <br />
          &nbsp; At the end of my Teenage, I went to the Mongolian University of
          Science and Technology for studying
