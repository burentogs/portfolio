    If you have a parent element with the class h-full relative and a child
    element with the class h-full, and the child element is not fitting within
    the parent element and is overflowing, there are a few possible solutions
    you can try: Make sure that the parent element has a defined width. The
    h-full class sets the element's height to be 100% of the height of its
    parent element, but if the parent element does not have a defined width, it
    will not constrain the child element's width. Make sure that the parent
    element has the overflow-hidden class. This will hide any content that
    overflows the parent element. Use the w-full class on the child element to
    set its width to be 100% of the width of its parent element. This will
    ensure that the child element takes up the full width of the parent element,
    even if its content overflows the parent element's height. Use the
    overflow-auto class on the parent element to add scrollbars to the parent
    element if its content overflows its bounds. This will allow the user to
    scroll to see the content that overflows the parent element. If the child
    element has a fixed height and is overflowing the parent element's height,
    you can use the overflow-y-scroll class on the child element to add a
    overflows the parent element. Use the w-full class on the child element to
    set its width to be 100% of the width of its parent element. This will
    ensure that the child element takes up the full width of the parent element,
    even if its content overflows the parent element's height. Use the
    overflow-auto class on the parent element to add scrollbars to the parent
    element if its content overflows its bounds. This will allow the user to
    scroll to see the content that overflows the parent element. If the child
    element has a fixed height and is overflowing the parent element's height,
    you can use the overflow-y-scroll class on the child element to add a
    overflows the parent element. Use the w-full class on the child element to
    set its width to be 100% of the width of its parent element. This will
